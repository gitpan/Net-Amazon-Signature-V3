NAME
    Net::Amazon::Signature::V3 - Sign AWS requests -- V3

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of Net::Amazon::Signature::V3 -
    released October 29, 2012 as part of Net-Amazon-Signature-V3.

SYNOPSIS
        # somewhere inside the depths of your code...
        my $signer = Net::Amazon::Signature::V3->new(id => $id, key => $key);
        my $req = HTTP::Request->new('GET', $uri, [ $signer->signed_headers ]);

        # profit!

DESCRIPTION
    Amazon requires authentication when interfacing with its web services;
    this package implements V3 of Amazon's authentication schemes.

METHODS
  signed_headers
    Returns a list of several key-value pairs suitable for including
    directly as headers. These headers will authenticate the request to
    Amazon.

    Note that these headers are only good when used within 5 minutes of the
    time that Amazon thinks it is.

    This routine is largely based off code extracted from "request" in
    Net::Amazon::Route53.

SEE ALSO
    Please see those modules/websites for more information related to this
    module.

    *   Net::Amazon::Route53 -- signed_headers() is largely based off of the
